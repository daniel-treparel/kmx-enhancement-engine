KMX Enhancer
============

An example / test implementation of an stanbol enhancement engine, making use
of a KMX webservice to apply a KMX classification model.

Current limitation is that a hardcoded SVM model is used to do the
classification. Reason being is that I am not sure if and how a consumer of the
enhancement engine can select a SVM model.
